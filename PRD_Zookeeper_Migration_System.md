# Product Requirements Document: Zookeeper Migration System

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
Build a zero-downtime migration system for Zookeeper clusters supporting Mesos infrastructure, enabling live migration of distributed coordination services while maintaining running workloads.

### 1.2 Scope
A comprehensive migration orchestration tool that synchronizes Zookeeper clusters bidirectionally, coordinates Mesos master/agent transitions, and ensures continuous service availability during infrastructure changes.

## 2. Problem Statement

Organizations running Mesos on Zookeeper need to migrate their coordination infrastructure (hardware upgrades, cloud migrations, cluster consolidations) without disrupting production workloads or causing task failures.

**Key Challenges:**
- Mesos masters and agents rely on Zookeeper for leader election and state
- Running tasks cannot tolerate coordination service interruptions
- Traditional migration approaches require downtime
- State synchronization across clusters is complex

## 3. Goals and Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Goals
1. **Zero-Downtime Migration**: Maintain 100% service availability during migration
2. **Data Consistency**: Ensure perfect state synchronization between clusters
3. **Task Continuity**: Preserve all running Mesos tasks without interruption
4. **Safe Rollback**: Support reverting to original cluster if issues arise

### 3.2 Success Metrics
- Zero task failures during migration
- < 100ms coordination latency during transition
- 100% data consistency between clusters
- < 5 minute cutover time for final transition
- Support for clusters with 1000+ nodes
